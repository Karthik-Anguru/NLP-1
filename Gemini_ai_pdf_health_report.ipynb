            "\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"O\" 1:160:** This tests for antibodies against *Salmonella Typhi*, a bacteria causing typhoid.  A result of 1:160 suggests a possible past or present typhoid infection.  The higher the number, the stronger the indication.  The reference range of 1:20 means results below this are considered negative.\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"H\" 1:80:** Similar to above, but a different part of the bacteria.  Again,  a result above the reference range suggests possible typhoid.\n",
            "* **S. Paratyphi \"AH\" 1:20:** Tests for antibodies against *Salmonella Paratyphi A*, another bacteria that can cause a typhoid-like illness. This result is within the normal range.\n",

            "**In summary for Widal:**  The slightly elevated S. Typhi \"O\" and \"H\" titres suggest a *possible* past or present typhoid infection.  However, this test isn't definitive on its own and further investigation might be needed.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Dengue NS1 Antigen, IgG, IgM:** All negative. This means there's no evidence of a current or past dengue infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):** Measures how quickly red blood cells settle in a test tube.  A high ESR can indicate inflammation or infection in the body.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **ESR 1st Hour 26 mm/hr:** This is slightly elevated (above the normal range of 0-8 mm/hr).\n",
